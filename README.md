# Obsidian-Suite Service Line ADmin Tools

Obsidian Suite is the latest attempt in rendering a management suite for general use

Develop a flexible and comprehensive system to manage staffing lists, assignments, supervisory hierarchy, position assignments, populate data on PDF forms, manage and route PDF documentation, generate reports, aggregate and process information from multiple sources, manage notification generated through the system and retain record of those notifications. 

Two storage options are intended to be incorporated. a SQLite database that can be accessed through shared drive and SQL server. Any initial implementation will need to be demonstrated without access a SQL server.

In working towards this goal I have created a prototype in MS access that handles many of these functions in an inelegant manner and with the issues inherent to MS Access. 

I have some limited programing experience. This is as much a learning experience as it is a needed solution. 

I welcome and will be grateful for any input and collaboration.
